# Introduction

<!-- 
  explain and survey metagenomics analysis, community profiling in particular.
  The different kinds of data, the focus on 16S. Why and where this is of interest.
-->

# Methods

<!-- 
  A list of technologies and tools used. We should describe at least

  - AWS including SQS, DynamoDB, EC2
  - nispero
  - Bio4j
  - mummer (nucmer)? masai? razers 3?
-->

> [#5](/../../issues/5)

# Results

<!--
  I really don't know what should go in here. It looks like a description of the tool, and how it works. Qualitative and quantitative characteristics (what it does, performance, requirements)
-->

# Discussion

<!-- 
  Why this tool. Motivate the design and technologies used
-->

# Conclusions
